  "A DSL for building Ring handlers from smaller routes.

  Compojure routes are semantically the same as Ring handlers, with the
  exception that routes may return `nil` to indicate they do not match.

  This namespace provides functions and macros for concisely constructing
  routes and combining them together to form more complex functions."
